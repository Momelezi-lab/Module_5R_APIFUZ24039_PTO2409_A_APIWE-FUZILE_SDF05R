## MY PROJECT



Project Overview
This project was a challenge to modify the colors of buttons using CSS. The main objective was to create visually appealing buttons with dynamic color changes based on user interactions such as hovering or clicking.

Design Choices
Color Scheme: I chose a combination of complementary colors to make the buttons stand out. These colors were selected to ensure good contrast and accessibility, making the buttons easy to see and use.

Hover Effects: I implemented hover effects where the button changes color when the user hovers over it. This subtle animation enhances the user experience by giving immediate visual feedback.

Active State: For the button’s active state (when it’s clicked), I selected a darker shade of the primary color to indicate that the button is being pressed.

Responsive Design: I ensured that the buttons are responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes by using relative units for width, height, and padding.

Challenges Faced
Cross-browser Compatibility: One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the CSS styles rendered consistently across different browsers. I had to experiment with various CSS properties to maintain the same look and feel.

Button Accessibility: Making sure that the buttons were accessible to users with disabilities, such as color blindness, was also a priority. I researched WCAG guidelines to ensure appropriate color contrast ratios.

Features I'm Proud Of
Smooth Transitions: I’m particularly proud of the smooth color transitions that occur when users hover over or click the buttons. This adds a polished feel to the user interface.

Customizable Styles: The button styles are flexible, allowing for easy customization of colors and effects. This makes the design adaptable for future projects or enhancements.


Overall, I found the project exciting as i was exploring diffent ways of styling my buttons.
